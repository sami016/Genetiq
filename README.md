# Genetiq

Genetic programming library, implemented in Java.
If you are interested in the library then please feel free to contribute!

# High-Level Goals

 - Object orientated approach to genetic algorithms.
 - Cohesive and interchangable modules.
 - Provide support for a range of populat GA techniques, and allow extensibility for new ones. 
 - Clean interface that is easy to use and understand.
 - Provide support for multi-core processing.
